          <tr>
            <td>green</td>
            <td>Color keywords</td>
            <td>Simple and easy! You can use the name of the color you are looking for instead of a value; however, it has to be a color keyword CSS knows. The amount of color keywords changes from different CSS versions, so while this type is straightforward, it can be very limiting.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>#008000</td>
            <td>Hex Values</td>
            <td>Hex can look pretty confusing at first but can be broken down into red, green, and blue using hexadecimal values. Each digit can range from 1-255 using hex(15) values 0-9 and A-F. So, for example, the Hex value of #008000 is just 00 for Red, 80 which translates to 120 for Green and 00 for blue. A significant benefit of this system is that hex values are nice and compact, and if all three parts of the hex value are the same double digits, for example, <span class=black>black #000000 </span>can be shortened to <span class=black>#000</span>.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>rgb(0,128,0)</td>
            <td>RGB Values</td>
            <td>Three values make up RBG: Red, Green, and Blue. These values range from 0-255. Where 0 is no amount of that color and 255 is the max amount of that color. The primary benefit of this type is that you can get an exact color since you control the amount of red, green, and blue used for your color and make slight changes by modifying the easy-to-understand variables!</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>hsl(120,100%,25%)</td>
            <td>HSL Values</td>
            <td>Three values make up HSL: hue, saturation, and light. It can be a little confusing at first, but once masted can give you a lot of control over how a color can look. The first aspect of the HSL value, hue, is a value that ranges from 0-360. Each value represents a degree on a color wheel, 0 being red, 120 being green, 240 being blue, and 360 being red again. The second aspect is saturation; this percentage value represents how saturated the color ranges from 0%-100%. The lower the color becomes, the more grey the color. Finally, the last aspect is Light, this is a percentage value ranging from 0%-100%, and this affects how light the color is, with 0% being the darkest and 100% being the lightest. Using this as your color value gives you an aspect of customization that other values don't have.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>hwb(120,0%,50%)</td>
            <td>HWB Value</td>
            <td>HWB values are similar to HSL because both use hue values. The main difference is instead of saturation and light, you have white and black. White and black are percentage values that range from 0%-100%, with the higher their percentage, the more white or black the color is, respectively. Note that both white and black color values should not equal more than 100%. When both do equal 100%, your color will appear grey, a mix of only black and white. HWB is generally easier to understand and change than HSL while providing similar benefits.</td>
